Fill in the next cell to simulate an  empirical distribution of Yes proportions with 10,000 resamples. In other words, use bootstrap resampling to simulate 10,000 election outcomes, and populate `resample_yes_proportions` with the yes proportion of each bootstrap resample. Then, visualize `resample_yes_proportions` with a histogram. You should see a bell shaped curve centered near the proportion of Yes in the original sample."
